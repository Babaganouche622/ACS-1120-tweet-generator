In this tutorial, we\â€™ll be writing a program which, given a source body of text, can perform operations to answer questions such as:

What is the least/most frequent word(s)?
How many different words are used?
What is the average (mean/median/mode) frequency of words in the text?
The structure to represent this kind of data is called a histogram, which really just means a count of things by category. In Python, you can represent a histogram in a variety of ways using the different data structures available. Part of the challenge of this tutorial is how to design and use these data structures to create a histogram.
